# CrateDig

**CrateDig** is an innovative iOS application designed to help music enthusiasts discover new underground music. Using the Spotify API, CrateDig provides personalized music recommendations based on genre, popularity, and BPM preferences, all through an engaging swipe interface.

## Features

- **Personalized Music Discovery**
  - Select from a variety of genres.
  - Adjust popularity levels to find mainstream or obscure tracks.
  - Set your preferred BPM range.

- **Swipe Interface**
  - Swipe left to skip to the next song.
  - Swipe right to revisit the previous song.
  - Each song is displayed on a card with title, artist, album, and release date.

- **Interactive UI**
  - Play/pause functionality with a rotating waveform image.
  - Overlay settings to adjust preferences on the fly.

- **Responsive Design**
  - Adaptable layout that maintains its relative size and position across different screen sizes.

- **User Feedback**
  - Displays a message when no more recommendations are available.

## How It Works

1. **Start the App**: Launch CrateDig to see the logo and segment buttons for Genre, Popularity, and BPM.
2. **Set Preferences**: Tap the segment buttons to open overlay settings and fine-tune your music discovery criteria.
3. **Discover Music**: Swipe left or right to navigate through the curated list of tracks. Play or pause the track directly from the card.
4. **Enjoy and Explore**: Keep swiping through recommendations. When you reach the end of the list, you’ll see a message to come back later for more suggestions.
